Help: alias(newkey,key): newkey is now an alias for key.
Doc: defines the keyword \var{newkey} as an alias for keyword \var{key}.
 \var{key} must correspond to an existing \emph{function} name. This is
 different from the general user macros in that alias expansion takes place
 immediately upon execution, without having to look up any function code, and
 is thus much faster. A sample alias file \kbd{misc/gpalias} is provided with
 the standard distribution. Alias commands are meant to be read upon startup
 from the \kbd{.gprc} file, to cope with function names you are dissatisfied
 with, and should be useless in interactive usage.
