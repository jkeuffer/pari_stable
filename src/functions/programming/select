Function: select

C-Name: select0
Prototype: GG
Help: select(A, f): selects elements of A according to the selection function f.
Doc: Given a vector, list or matrix \kbd{A} and a \typ{CLOSURE} \kbd{f},
 returns the elements $x$ of \kbd{A} such that $f(x)$ is non-zero. In other
 words, \kbd{f} is seen as a selection function returning a boolean value.
 \bprog
 ? select(vector(50,i,i^2+1), x->isprime(x))
 %1 = [2, 5, 17, 37, 101, 197, 257, 401, 577, 677, 1297, 1601]
 ? select(%, x->(x<100))
 %2 = [2, 5, 17, 37]
 @eprog\noindent returns the primes of the form $i^2+1$ for some $i\leq 50$,
 then the elements less than 100 in the preceding result. The following
 function lists the elements in $(\Z/N\Z)^*$:
 \bprog
 ? invertibles(N) = select(vector(N,i,i), x->gcd(x,N) == 1)
 @eprog

 \noindent Finally
 \bprog
 ? select(M, x->x)
 @eprog\noindent selects the non-0 entries in \kbd{M}. If the latter is a
 \typ{MAT}, we extract the matrix of non-0 columns. Note that \emph{removing}
 entries instead of selecting them just involves replacing the selection
 function \kbd{f} with its negation:
 \bprog
 ? select(vector(50,i,i^2+1), x->!isprime(x))
 @eprog
