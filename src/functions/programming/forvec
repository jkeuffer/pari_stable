Function: forvec
Section: programming
C-Name: forvec
Prototype: vV=GID0,L,
Help: forvec(x=v,seq,{flag=0}): v being a vector of two-component vectors of
 length n, the sequence is evaluated with x[i] going from v[i][1] to v[i][2]
 for i=n,..,1 if flag is zero or omitted. If flag = 1 (resp. flag = 2),
 restrict to increasing (resp. strictly increasing) sequences
