C-Name: gbitnegimply
Prototype: GG
Help: bitnegimply(x,y): bitwise "negated imply" of two integers x and y,
 in other words, x BITAND BITNEG(y). Negative numbers behave as if modulo big
 power of 2.
Description:
 (small, small):small:parens	$(1)&~$(2)
 (gen, gen):int	gbitnegimply($1, $2)
Doc:
 bitwise negated imply of two integers $x$ and
 $y$ (or \kbd{not} $(x \Rightarrow y)$), that is the integer $$\sum
 (x_i~\kbd{and not}(y_i)) 2^i$$

 See \secref{se:bitand} for the behaviour for negative arguments.
