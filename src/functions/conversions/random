C-Name: genrand
Prototype: DG
Help: random({N=2^31}): random integer between 0 and N-1.
Description:
 (?int):int	genrand($1)
 (real):void	$"incorrect type `real' in random"
Doc:
 returns a (pseudo-)random integer
 uniformly distributed between $0$ and $N-1$. $N$ is an integer, which can be
 arbitrary large. The random seed may be obtained via \tet{getrand}, and reset
 using \tet{setrand}: from a given seed, the exact same values will be
 generated. The same seed is used at each startup, reseed the generator
 yourself if this is a problem.

 Note that \kbd{random(2\pow31)} \emph{is} equivalent to \kbd{random()}. This
 was not the case, up to version 2.4.

 This function does not depend on the system's random number generator. Up to
 version 2.4 included, pseudo-random numbers were obtained by means of linear
 congruences and were not well distributed in arithmetic progressions. We now
 use Brent's XORGEN algorithm, based on Feedback Shift Registers, see
 \kbd{http://wwwmaths.anu.edu.au/~brent/random.html}. The generator has period
 $2^{4096}-1$, passes the Crush battery of statistical tests of L'Ecuyer and
 Simard, but is not suitable for cryptographic purposes: one can reconstruct
 the state vector from a small sample of consecutive values, thus predicting
 the entire sequence.
