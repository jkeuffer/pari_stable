Function: Ser
Section: conversions
C-Name: gtoser
Prototype: GDn
Help: Ser(x,{v=x}): convert x (usually a vector) into a power series with
 variable v, starting with the constant coefficient.
Doc: transforms the object $x$ into a power series
 with main variable $v$ ($x$ by default). If $x$ is a scalar, this gives a
 constant power series with precision given by the default \kbd{serieslength}
 (corresponding to the C global variable \kbd{precdl}). If $x$ is a
 polynomial, the precision is the greatest of \kbd{precdl} and the degree of
 the polynomial. If $x$ is a vector, the precision is similarly given, and the
 coefficients of the vector are understood to be the coefficients of the power
 series starting from the constant term (i.e.~the reverse of the function
 \kbd{Pol}).

 The warning given for \kbd{Pol} also applies here: this is not a substitution
 function.
