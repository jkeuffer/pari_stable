Function: rnfpolredbest
Section: number_fields
C-Name: rnfpolredbest
Prototype: GGD0,L,
Help: rnfpolredbest(nf,pol,{flag=0}): given a pol with coefficients in nf,
 finds a relative simpler polynomial defining the same field. Binary digits
 of flag mean: 1: return also the element whose characteristic polynomial is
 the given polynomial, 2: return an absolute polynomial.
Doc: relative version of \kbd{polredbest}. Given a monic polynomial \var{pol}
 with coefficients in $\var{nf}$, finds a simpler relative polynomial defining
 the same field. The binary digits of $\fl$ mean

 1: returns $[P,a]$ where $P$ is the default output and $a$ is an
 element expressed on a root of $P$ whose characteristic polynomial is
 \var{pol}

 2: returns an absolute polynomial (same as
 {\tt rnfequation(\var{nf},rnfpolredbest(\var{nf},\var{pol}))}
 but faster).

 As opposed to \tet{rnfpolredabs} this function does not return a
 \emph{smallest} (canonical) polynomial with respect to some criterion,
 but it does run in polynomial time.

 \misctitle{Remark} In the present implementation, \kbd{rnfpolredbest}
 produces smaller polynomials than \kbd{rnfpolred} and is usually much
 faster. The \kbd{rnfpolred} implementation is based on (a partial
 implementation of) an incomplete reduction theory of lattices over number
 fields, the function \kbd{rnflllgram}, which deserves to be improved.
