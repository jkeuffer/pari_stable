Function: idealappr
Section: number_fields
C-Name: idealappr0
Prototype: GGD0,L,
Help: idealappr(nf,x,{flag=0}): x being a fractional ideal, gives an element
 b such that v_p(b)=v_p(x) for all prime ideals p dividing x, and v_p(b)>=0
 for all other p. If (optional) flag is non-null x must be a prime ideal
 factorization with possibly zero exponents.
Doc: if $x$ is a fractional ideal
 (given in any form), gives an element $\alpha$ in $\var{nf}$ such that for
 all prime ideals $\wp$ such that the valuation of $x$ at $\wp$ is non-zero, we
 have $v_{\wp}(\alpha)=v_{\wp}(x)$, and. $v_{\wp}(\alpha)\ge0$ for all other
 ${\wp}$.

 If $\fl$ is non-zero, $x$ must be given as a prime ideal factorization, as
 output by \kbd{idealfactor}, but possibly with zero or negative exponents.
 This yields an element $\alpha$ such that for all prime ideals $\wp$ occurring
 in $x$, $v_{\wp}(\alpha)$ is equal to the exponent of $\wp$ in $x$, and for all
 other prime ideals, $v_{\wp}(\alpha)\ge0$. This generalizes
 $\kbd{idealappr}(\var{nf},x,0)$ since zero exponents are allowed. Note that
 the algorithm used is slightly different, so that
 \kbd{idealappr(\var{nf},idealfactor(\var{nf},x))} may not be the same as
 \kbd{idealappr(\var{nf},x,1)}.
