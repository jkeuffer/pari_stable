Function: zetakinit
Section: number_fields
C-Name: initzeta
Prototype: Gp
Help: zetakinit(x): compute number field information necessary to use zetak,
 where x is an irreducible polynomial.
Doc: computes a number of initialization data
 concerning the number field defined by the polynomial $x$ so as to be able
 to compute the \idx{Dedekind} zeta and lambda functions (respectively
 $\kbd{zetak}(x)$ and $\kbd{zetak}(x,1)$). This function calls in particular
 the \kbd{bnfinit} program. The result is a 9-component vector $v$ whose
 components are very technical and cannot really be used by the user except
 through the \kbd{zetak} function. The only component which can be used if
 it has not been computed already is $v[1][4]$ which is the result of the
 \kbd{bnfinit} call.

 This function is very inefficient and should be rewritten. It needs to
 computes millions of coefficients of the corresponding Dirichlet series if
 the precision is big. Unless the discriminant is small it will not be able
 to handle more than 9 digits of relative precision. For instance,
 \kbd{zetakinit(x\pow 8 - 2)} needs 440MB of memory at default precision.
