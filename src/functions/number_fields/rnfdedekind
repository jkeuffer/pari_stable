C-Name: rnfdedekind
Prototype: GGG
Help: rnfdedekind(nf,pol,pr): relative Dedekind criterion over nf, applied to
 the order defined by a root of irreducible polynomial pol, modulo the prime
 ideal pr. Returns [flag,basis,val], where basis is a pseudo-basis of the
 enlarged order, flag is 1 iff this order is pr-maximal, and val is the
 valuation in pr of the order discriminant.
Doc: given a number field
 $\var{nf}$ as output by \kbd{nfinit} and a polynomial \var{pol} with
 coefficients in $\var{nf}$ defining a relative extension $L$ of $\var{nf}$,
 evaluates the relative \idx{Dedekind} criterion over the order defined by a
 root of \var{pol} for the prime ideal \var{pr} and outputs a 3-component
 vector as the result. The first component is a flag equal to 1 if the
 enlarged order could be proven to be \var{pr}-maximal and to 0 otherwise (it
 may be maximal in the latter case if \var{pr} is ramified in $L$), the second
 component is a pseudo-basis of the enlarged order and the third component is
 the valuation at \var{pr} of the order discriminant.
