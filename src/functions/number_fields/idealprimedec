Help: idealprimedec(nf,p): prime ideal decomposition of the prime number p
 in the number field nf as a vector of 5 component vectors [p,a,e,f,b]
 representing the prime ideals pZ_K+a. Z_K, e,f as usual, a as vector of
 components on the integral basis, b Lenstra's constant.
Doc: computes the prime ideal
 decomposition of the prime number $p$ in the number field $\var{nf}$. $p$
 must be a (positive) prime number. Note that the fact that $p$ is prime is
 not checked, so if a non-prime $p$ is given the result is undefined.

 The result is a vector of \tev{prid} structures, each representing one of the
 prime ideals above $p$ in the number field $\var{nf}$. The representation
 $P=[p,a,e,f,b]$ of a prime ideal means the following. The prime ideal is
 equal to $p\Z_K+\alpha\Z_K$ where $\Z_K$ is the ring of integers of the field
 and $\alpha=\sum_i a_i\omega_i$ where the $\omega_i$ form the integral basis
 \kbd{\var{nf}.zk}, $e$ is the ramification index, $f$ is the residual index,
 and $b$ represents a $\beta\in\Z_K$ such that $P^{-1}=\Z_K+\beta/p\Z_K$ which
 will be useful for computing valuations, but which the user can ignore. The
 number $\alpha$ is guaranteed to have a valuation equal to 1 at the prime
 ideal (this is automatic if $e>1$).

 The components of \kbd{P} should be accessed by member functions: \kbd{P.p},
 \kbd{P.e}, \kbd{P.f}, and \kbd{P.gen} (returns the vector $[p,a]$).
