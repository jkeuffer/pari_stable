Assuming you're on a fairly standard Unix system and you are in a hurry, you
can quickly build/test GP in the following way:

a) look at MACHINES to see if anything funny applies to your configuration
b) ./Configure (--prefix=/exotic/dir/name if desired. Default is /usr/local)
c) make all, make bench
d) make install if desired
e) copy misc/gprc.dft to /etc/gprc [sitewide] or $HOME/.gprc [personal]
f) you can find documentation, tutorial and reference card in directory doc.

That's it!
f) the data for polgalois() function (12 > degree > 7) is provided in a
separate archive galdata.tgz, which you have to fetch separately.

Compile and read doc/INSTALL.tex (e.g cd doc; tex INSTALL; xdvi INSTALL) for
more detailed information and various hints.

P.S: data for polgalois() function (12 > degree > 7) is provided in a
separate archive galdata.tgz, which you have to fetch separately.

P.S2: the same procedure should work on
  Windows 95/98/NT: with the cygwin package
  OS/2            : with EMX, GNU tools, and pdksh
