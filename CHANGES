    2- check for strftime in Configure
    3- support for alpha running linux (include portability fix on keralpha.s)
    4- file MACHINES
    5- made message for "array index out of range" error more precise
    6- more frequent garbage collecting in mathnf
BH  7- inline asm for i386
GN  8- support for native compiler on AIX

  Removed
    1- support for dynamic linking on AIX (did not work)

===========================================================================
Done for version 2.0.3.alpha (released 13/01/98):

  Fixed:
    1- rare bug in gadd (PADIC + PADIC) which caused one of the arguments
       to be overwritten
    2- typos in refcard
    3- galois.c still couldn't compile on the HP (_INCLUDE_POSIX_SOURCE)
    4- introduced in 2.0.2: item 14 used gexpo incorrectly (bnfinit sometimes
       did not give units it could have computed)
    5- replaced INFINITY by pariINFINITY in rootpol.c (cancels Warning on OS/2)
    6- on OS/2, target ../gp-$dft in o.xxx/Makefile could not be built
       (extraneous $exe_suff)
    7- command line switches so that one can enter them with or without white
       space (new function read_arg in gp.c)
    8- setdcolors so that it can't unset disable_colors if we are under emacs
   11- random did not check its argument correctly (random(2^32) was accepted)
   12- b=10; for(a=1,b, b=2) exited immediately, whereas the upper bound is
       supposed to be evaluated only once
   13- reorganized the error recovery system (initially because errpile could
       cause SEGV on Linux systems)
   14- typo. problems in doc and refcard (interletter spacing in $nfz$...)

  Changed:
    1- Reorganized Makefile.SH: extraction twice as fast
    2- pari.menu and pariemacs.txt rewritten, pari.el updated
    3- expanded the man gp.1 to mention command line switches
    4- the implied input from non-interactive input command (like extern and
       read) does not go into the GP history (%x) anymore (it never went into
       readline's). The final output (value of last expression evaluated) of
       course still does!
    5- updated chapter 5 of the User's Manual (removed obsolete information)

  Added:
    1- better settings for handling the Meta key under readline in
       examples/Inputrc
YU  2- support for shared libraries under FreeBSD
    3- colors under Emacs
       1) emulate exactly the "colors" default after a M-x gp
       2) .gp files edited get a special highlighting
    4- a flag to default() to get the result under GP
    5- overloaded the "." (member) operator to concatenate as strings if LHS is
       a string
    6- .gprc accepts some limited preprocessing directive (#if READL and
       #if EMACS (and #ifnot as well)). Updated lib/gprc.default to reflect the
       changes

  Removed:
    1- some unused, undocumented functions (allocatemem(), checksqid())
       made static some other (op_ReIm)

===========================================================================
Done for version 2.0.2.alpha (released 15/12/1997):

  Fixed:
    1- typos in the documentation for the random() function
    2- removed an extra -emacs flag in pari.el
    3- decodefactor was incorrectly remembered by whatnow (it's factorback now)
    4- test mode did not prevent all prompt expansion (==> bug in make test)
    5- gphelp stopped abruptly when meeting a cross-referencing macro
    6- zetainit now aborts cleanly when disc. too big (caused memory fault)
    7- exceedingly rare bug in the printing of real numbers (missing decimals)
    8- too early rounding in polroots which in rare cases made GP think some
       error had happened
    9- text overflowed the manual pages (and tutorial) on non-A4 paper
   10- polred incorrectly assumed that nf arguments were totally real (in a non
       critical part: that just led to some unnecessary computations)
   11- polred(f,2) could try to overwrite universal integer gzero
   12- check if we are using GNU as or GNU ld in Configure
   13- empty -R argument to $CC when building GP without graphics (==> link
       failed)
   14- bnfinit acts sensibly when fundamental units are too large (before:
       "overflow in R*R")
   15- cleaned up buch2.c (removed ideallllredpart1, removed gerepile in
       class_group_generators(), not_given now called from getfu)
   16- nfgaloisconj(...,2) was unusable (tried an illegal multiplication)
   17- is_totally_split was very inefficient (==> nfgaloisconj was very slow)
   18- some unimportant typos (gexpo) in polgalois
   19- compiling without readline gave a Warning in gp.c (already_hist)
   20- some make programs don't like $< (suppressed from doc/Makefile)
   21- ellap sometimes assumed wrongly that coeffs of the curve were integers
   22- flag 0 and 1 in ellap had been mixed up
   23- print an extra \n before an error message if last output did not
       include it
   24- component(any non recursive type) gave a SEGV
   25- suminf / prodinf / prodeuler assumed they treated a real expression
   26- lindep / algep had problems with numbers having a rational component
   27- last significant digits of bessel* and hyperu were wrong (now only the
       last one is)
   28- expi now returns a long as documented (expi(gzero) returned 0 on 64-bit
       machines!)
   29- g++ could not compile libpari.a (casts missing, extraneous extern "C",
       faulty inline, etc.)
   30- cleaned up the enums in gp.h
   31- incorrect target veryclean in doc/Makefile

  Changed:
    1- '_' is now valid in GP identifiers
    2- removed subsections from table of contents. pages in the manual are now
       numbered consecutively
    3- gexpo now accepts exact 0 arguments (return -HIGHEXPOBIT)
       gexpo for complex numbers now return max(gexpo(Re), gexpo(Im))
    4- parts of lib/gprc.default
    5- the second argument of subgrouplist is now optional

  Removed:
    1- buggy label/goto functions
    2- (now unused) error messages: labeler, gexpoer2
    3- _ as shorthand for conj()
    4- (useless, undocumented) function gnormalize
    5- some files in the lib directory (functions, gp)

  Added:
    1- some files in the lib directory (README, pari.xbm, xgp)

==============================================================================
Done for version 2.0.1.alpha (released 29/11/1997):

  Fixed:
    1- multiple factors forgotten when factoring univariate pols over Z
    2- extraneous modifications of the random seed (period of random
       generator was ridiculously small for some buchxxx functions). Change
       the bench results (in a non essential way)
    3- bad terminal size determination
    4- aliases incorrectly killed (possible SEGV)
    5- incrementing/decrementing array elements with the (valid) syntax
      v[i]++ / v[i]-- caused a weird error message
    6- subgrouplist() could end up by a SEGV on Linux systems
LG  7- on HP-UX, flag -Aa not taken into account in Configure (caused it to
       fail on has_TIOCGWINSZ.c)
LG  8- added a missing #define _INCLUDE_POSIX_SOURCE in galois.c
       (7 & 8 independently fixed by OV)
GN  9- the script examples/cl.gp called vecconcat() instead of concat()
GN 10- make install-sta rebuilt gp-sta unnecessarily
GN 11- many, many typos in the tutorial
   12- tu / fu applied incorrectly to a bnfclassunit
   13- bnfclassunit did not output a valid object (matrix whose elements were
       rows instead of columns)
   14- conversion bug from t_QUAD to t_REAL/t_COMPLEX
   15- off-by-1 error in the history recovery after an error
   16- in fprintferr() (debug messages), embedded %Z did not work correctly
   17- rnfequation over Q yielded a SEGV
   18- string() in compatibility mode corrupted the stack
   19- it is now safe to have colours in prompt and input line under readline
   20- default colours restored upon exiting
   21- default colors in lib/gprc.default used 0 instead of -1 for "no color"
   22- psi and lngamma could give wrong results when the argument was not real
   23- the make test-graphic bench was missing a newline
   24- Pol(break) gave a SEGV
   25- x=1; Pol(1) gave a stupid error message
IZ 26- tutorial.tex was unnecessarily rebuilt
   27- typos in ggcd (cases nobody will ever access: gcd of a non-reduced
LG     fraction with an intmod, etc.)
LG 28- incorrect handling of integrals of vectors
   29- gcd of polynomials with non-exact coeffs gave stupid results (they are
       still often wrong, since the mathematical notion is rather imprecise)
   30- typos in rnfkummer (incorrect flag handling)
   31- typo in idealpowprime (negative exponent gave wrong denominator)
   32- multiplication t_COMPLEX x t_COMPLEX used 4 mult. instead of 3
   33- some modular functions (j, f, f2) rewritten to take advantage of new eta
       function (trueta)

   Changed:
    1- ?? (gphelp) starts in detex mode (-d) from a console window. tmp files
       now placed according to the $TMPDIR environment variable (in /tmp by
       default)
    2- /usr/local/lib/pari/data is a better place for the Galois resolvents
       (which are not included yet in the standard distribution)
    3- The example for prompt in gprc.default to discuss escape sequences under
       readline
    4- Configure now starts by searching the toplevel directory for a temporary
       readline installation
    5- The output of default(colors) was confusing. It is a string now
    6- third argument of polinterpolate can be arbitrary and is now optional
       ("x" by default) (it had to be numeric)
    7- directory configure renamed config, some of the Makefiles in there as
       well (to avoid confusion)
    8- the low_stack macro to facilitate dynamic stack expansion
    9- if, back to GP main loop, the last command was a print1(), output an
       extra newline. This way the prompt is guaranteed to be anchored on
       column 1 (suppresses a readline display bug as well)
   10- Due to 9, pari.el now supposes the prompt starts in col. 1
   11- Better handling of version numbers (LG)
   12- decodefactor() renamed to factorback()
 
   Removed:
    1- The (unused, undocumented) Malloc_Procs functions and macros
    2- The (now unused) error message numvarer
    3- some (useless, undocumented) targets in the top Makefile
    4- (useless, undocumented) function polgcd()
 
   Added:
    1- This file !
    2- new flags -ch, -cb, -cu (colour support) to gphelp (see its header)
IZ  3- OS/2 (+ enough tools...) supported by Configure
    4- file examples/Inputrc (example of .inputrc for readline)
    5- Weber f1 function implemented
    6- Karatsuba multiplication t_REAL x t_REAL (development code, not used by
       PARI yet). Test it with install if you wish
