Done for version 2.7.2 (released ??/??/2014):
[last column crossreferences current development release 2.8.0]

  Fixed
    1- gaffsg(0, t_PADIC): wrong valuation                                [F21]
    2- (t_INTMOD with word-sized modulus)^(huge negative power) [#1584]   [F24]
    3- (gp -p N) or (primelimit=N in gprc_ for N >= 436273290 resulted in an
       incorrect primetable. N.B. Such commands are now useless: needed primes
       are produced dynamically anyway.                                   [F25]
    4- monomial(exact zero, d, v) returned an invalid t_POL / t_RFRAC     [F26]
    5- contfracpnqn(v, n) returned partial quotients p[-1]/q[-1] ...
       p[n-1]/q[n-1], instead of the documented p[0]/q[0] ... p[n]/q[n]   [F27]
    6- factor((3+4*I)/25) -> factor 2+I had 0 exponent [#1586]            [F29]

Done for version 2.7.1 (released 16/05/2014):
[last column crossreferences current development release 2.8.0]

  Fixed
    1- make install fails on OS/X: ln -s libpari.dylib libpari.dylib fails [F1]
    2- Q_pvalrem(t_FRAC) => wrong result                                   [F2]
    3- [] == 0 but []~ != 0  (now []~ == 0 as well) [#1560]                [F3]
BA  4- test-kernel did not work when using --mt=pthread                    [F4]
BA  5- ellheegner was using too much memory in some case                   [F5]
BA  6- ellap can overflow on 32-bit machine [#1558] (minimal fix)          [F6]
    7- nfhilbert(K,x,y, P above 2) could give wrong results [#1561]        [F7]
    8- gcd(1/2, 1+I*1.) -> SEGV [#1563]                                   [F10]
    9- mathnf(t_VEC) could corrupt input (change sign)                    [F11]
   10- [libpari] RgM_transmul did not work                                [F12]
   11- [libpari] Fq_issquare didn't support T=NULL                        [F13]
   12- [libpari] nfpow_u didn't handle non-integral rational numbers      [F14]
   13- eint1(0) -> stack overflow [#1568]                                 [F15]
   14- nfroots(, t_POL with leading coeff -1) could miss solutions        [F19]
   15- precprime(1) -> invalid t_INT [#1576]                              [F20]
